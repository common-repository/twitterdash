twitterDash adds twitter to your WordPress-dashboard.

== Description ==

twitterDash adds a field on the Dashboard. In this field you find the last(you can define how many) updates on the friends timeline of your twitter(http://www.twitter.com) account.

You will see your friends profile images, usernames and updates, all the links that they have posted are active and the "@username" links to that users timeline.

Enable the update panel and you can update your own timeline from your Dashboard.

This plugin does not require the PHP cURL-extension, you can run this on every server.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the twitterDash-folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
